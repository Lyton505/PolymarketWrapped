   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Then fill in your values:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BADGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMASTER_URL=your_paymaster_url

## Smart Contract Deployment

### Deploy to Base

The `PolymarketWrappedBadge` contract is located in `/contracts/PolymarketWrappedBadge.sol`.

**⚠️ Note:** Due to dependency conflicts, we recommend deploying the contract separately.

See **[CONTRACT_DEPLOYMENT.md](CONTRACT_DEPLOYMENT.md)** for detailed deployment instructions using:

- ✨ Remix IDE (easiest, browser-based)
- 🔨 Foundry (recommended for production)
- 📦 Separate Hardhat project

**Contract Features:**

- ERC-721 compliant NFT
- One badge per address per year
- Custom metadata URI for each badge
- Gas-efficient minting
- Compatible with ERC-4337 account abstraction

### Paymaster Setup

For gasless minting, integrate with a Paymaster service:

1. **Alchemy Account Kit** (Recommended)
   - Sign up at [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
   - Enable Paymaster for Base
   - Get your Paymaster URL

2. **Pimlico**
   - Sign up at [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/)
   - Configure Base sponsorship
   - Get your Paymaster endpoint

3. Update `.env.local` with your Paymaster URL

2. Copy [`contracts/PolymarketWrappedBadge.sol`](contracts/PolymarketWrappedBadge.sol)
3. Compile and deploy to Base Mainnet
4. Copy the deployed contract address

See [`CONTRACT_DEPLOYMENT.md`](CONTRACT_DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Deploy Frontend

**Deploy to Vercel (Recommended):**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

**Environment Variables (set in Vercel dashboard):**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` - From cloud.walletconnect.com
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BADGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` - Your deployed contract address
- `POLYMARKET_API_KEY` - Optional, for higher rate limits
